Conducted the necessary analyses of vaccination rates in California school districts and compared them to the vaccination rates in the US in the past years. Using this study, we might be able to improve the reporting rates and the vaccination rates of the districts by finding out the factors directly affecting the vaccination rate.

• Used RStudio to perform data cleaning, data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis with the help
of tidyverse.

• Performed feature engineering by logarithmically transforming 4 attributes for better model accuracy.

• Performed time series analysis to study notable trends or cyclical variation in U.S. vaccination rates.

• Implemented linear and logistic regression algorithms using the Bayesian and Frequentist approaches.
Conducted thorough analysis of the model by studying the residuals, Q-Q plots, multicollinearity,
Cook's distance.

• Conducted hypothesis testing (Dickey-Fuller test, Shapiro-Wilk test, Pearson’s correlation test,
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test etc.) to obtain enough statistical evidence for my analysis.

• Used packages like caret, dlookr, DHARMa, visdat, gvlma, BayesFactor, tidyverse, psych.
